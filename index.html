    <p><b>Ingredients</b>
      <ol>
        <li>1 cup finely ground graham crackers (from 9 crackers)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, room temperature
        </li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh Key lime juice, plus 2 teaspoons grated zest (from 16 limes), and thinly sliced lime rounds for serving</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar
        </li>
        
        
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<p><b>How to make it </b>
      </ol>
   
  <li>1. Whisk together cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Stir in butter until mixture resembles wet sand and holds together when squeezed. Press evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Freeze until firm, 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>2. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and condensed milk on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add lime juice, zest, and vanilla. Beat 1 minute more.</li>      
  <li>3. In a separate bowl, whip cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold into cream-cheese mixture. Pour over chilled crust; smooth top with an offset spatula. Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.</li>
  <li>4. Run a knife along cake's edge before releasing sides of pan, then under bottom to loosen. Serve, garnished with lime rounds.</li>
